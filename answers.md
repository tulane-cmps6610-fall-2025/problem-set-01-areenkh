1. **Asymptotic notation**

  - 1b    
 
  - 1c

  - 1d

  - 1e

  - 1f

  - 1g

2. **SPARC to Python**

  - 2b
  This function computes the greatest common divisor of its two arguments. 

  - 2c
  Work is Θ(log min(a,b)) and Span is Θ(log min(a,b)). Each recursive step does O(1) work and strictly reduces the smaller argument. The worse case follow the Fibonacci bound giving Θ(log min(a, b)) steps. Because there's only one recursive call per step, span equals the number of steps. 

3. **Parallelism and recursion**

  - 3b

  - 3d

  - 3e
  
4. **GCD**
